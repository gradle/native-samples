= Swift application with C++ library dependencies (cpp-dependencies)

This sample demonstrates using a C++ library from Swift.

```
> cd swift/cpp-dependencies
> ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s

> ./app/build/install/main/debug/app
Hello, World!
```

There are three projects in this sample: a shared C++ library (`:list`), a static C++ library (`:listStatic`), and a swift application with a dependency on the shared C++ library (`:app`).

By default, when building the application, only the shared library will be built and used.
To change the application to use the static library instead, change the dependency in [app/build.gradle](swift/cpp-dependencies/app/build.gradle#L9) to depend on the `:listStatic` project instead of `:list`.
You'll also need to change [app/src/main/swift/LinkedList.swift](swift/cpp-dependencies/app/src/main/swift/LinkedList.swift#L4) to import the "listStatic" module (rather than the "list" module).
